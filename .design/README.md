## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Sniffnet is an application to empower everyone with a tool to comfortably monitor their Internet traffic.

The main pillar of Sniffnet is to represent in a straightforward way concepts that are usually considered advanced:
for this reason implementing an optimal UI for the application is crucially important.

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out [open design issues](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/labels/design) here on GitHub (we label them with the `design` label).
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design` label for it.
3. Add your ideas to an issue, and I promise I will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions.

**I encourage you to:**

- Get in touch with me by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/gyulyvgc/sniffnet/discussions).
- Check out the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## ðŸš€ The Main Product

Sniffnet can be downloaded from [here](https://sniffnet.net/download/).

### Target audience

All users with a decent amount of technological knowledge.

### Design files

> Since I do not have a design team at hand most of the product does not have any Design files, and you'll be forced to browse through the product itself and propose improvements.

## ðŸ’… Design relevant materials

Here is a list of design relevant information and materials:

### Fonts

Sniffnet uses `Sarasa Gothic mono`. The fonts used can be found [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/main/resources/fonts).

### Colors and components

For info on the used RGB colors as well as the UI components, I suggest you to give a look at the files in the [styles folder](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/src/gui/styles).

### Logos

You can find a set of logos [here](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/tree/main/resources/logos/raw).

## ðŸŽ“ License

[MIT](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) or [APACHE 2.0](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE) at your choice.
