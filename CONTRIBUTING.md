# How can you contribute to the Sniffnet project?

There are basically two ways: 
- you can donate to show your support
- you can use your technical expertise to help improve the application

In the first case, you may be interested in giving a look at [my sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/GyulyVGC).

In the second case, this file is what you're searching for.

## Did you find a bug?

If you have found a bug in the application, it'd be awesome if you could open an issue describing the problem. 

You should include a title, a description, and possibly a screenshot demonstrating the problem.

Before opening an issue, please make sure the bug was not already reported.


## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

If you have detected a bug and solved it, please open a pull request with your patch. 

Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and your solution to that problem.


## Are you willing to help but don't know where to start?

You can give a look at the [project roadmap](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) to see the features I'd like to implement next, or check out issues labeled with the tag "[help wanted](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/labels/help%20wanted)" to see what I'm struggling with.

All proposals to enlarge or improve Sniffnet are warmly welcomed, join the discussion and don't hesitate to share your thoughts!
